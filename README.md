The objective is to develop a blockchain-enabled loyalty and rewards program for E-commerce platforms, leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and user engagement.

<ul>
  
<li>Develop a blockchain-based project to generate loyalty points as fungible tokens on the blockchain.</li>
<li> Define the tokenomics for the fungible tokens such as the value of tokens, and the number of tokens to be issued. Rules and regulations for the governance of treasury to be managed on a day-to-day basis should be also clearly defined. LINK </li>
<li> The account settlement/reconciliation process of fungible tokens should be made more effective between Brands and E-commerce platforms, meaning settlements of fungible tokens should be simple and instant and should be recorded on-chain. </li>
<li> Define rules for earning fungible tokens based on user actions such as purchases, referrals, or social media interactions and distribute these fungible tokens to customers' digital wallets securely and transparently using blockchain transactions.</li>
<li> Platform partners or sellers should also be able to issue these fungible tokens to loyal customers.</li>
<li> Customers can then use their fungible tokens to earn rewards from sellers or partners, each being recorded on the blockchain for transparency and to prevent double-spending.</li>
<li>All the transactions revolving around fungible tokens should be recorded on-chain.</li>
<li>Build a user-friendly interface for users to manage their loyalty points, view available rewards, and track their progress. The interface should provide a clear overview of earned loyalty points, past transactions, and available redemption options.</li>
<li>You can use the Polygon blockchain to deploy your solution and demo the final product as a web prototype.</li>
</ul>

# What we are expecting:
The loyalty program should generate fungible tokens on the blockchain as loyalty points, representing the value earned by users through various actions such as purchases, referrals, or social media interactions.

Users should be to understand the criteria for earning fungible tokens, including clear rules and guidelines for different actions and transactions.

Tokenomics of fungible tokens should be transparent to brands to accept and issue tokens as well as to manage their collective treasury.

Any user should be able to track their loyalty points(fungible tokens) and view their earning history.

Partners and sellers can easily reward their loyal users and should be able to solve their settlements of fungible tokens with E-commerce platforms easily on-chain.

All the transactions involving fungible tokens should be on-chain and recorded, proving every settlement performed.

Bonus: GUI-based tool that doesn’t require knowledge of any Blockchain programming to use by Brands and Retailers or customers.

Bonus: Add decaying nature for fungible tokens in the customer’s wallet after a certain period.

Judging Criteria:
The demo of the key feature/functions you were able to implement should be simple (No code to be used in the demo)
Clean and well-structured Solidity code/templates
Feature sets
